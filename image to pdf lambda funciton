explain the above code in simple language

The above code is a Lambda function written in Python which is used to convert an image file to a PDF file. It is triggered when an image file is uploaded to an S3 bucket. The function first checks if the file is an image file (jpeg or png) and then reads the image data, converts it to a PDF, and uploads the PDF to the same S3 bucket.
