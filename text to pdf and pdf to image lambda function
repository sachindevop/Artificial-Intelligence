explain the above code in simple language

The above code is a Lambda function written in Python which is used to convert text files to PDF files and PDF files to images. It is triggered when a file is uploaded to an S3 bucket. The function first checks if the file is a text file or a PDF and then reads the data, converts it to the other file type, and uploads the file to the same S3 bucket.

explain the above code in simple language

The above code is a CloudFormation template written in YAML which is used to deploy relevant resources for the Lambda function. It creates an S3 bucket, a Lambda function, and an IAM role that allows the Lambda function to access the S3 bucket. The S3 bucket is configured to trigger the Lambda function when a text file or PDF is uploaded.
