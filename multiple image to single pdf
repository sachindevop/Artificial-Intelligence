explain the above code in simple language

The above code is a Lambda function written in Python which is used to merge multiple image files into a single PDF file. It is triggered when multiple image files are uploaded to an S3 bucket. The function reads the images from the bucket, merges them into a single PDF file, and then uploads the PDF to the same S3 bucket.
