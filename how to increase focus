how to increase focus

1. Set goals: Setting goals gives you something to focus on, and having measurable goals to achieve can help motivate you and refocus when you drift off. 

2. Prioritise tasks: what’s the most important thing you have to do right now? Tackle it first and take care of your most important tasks first. 

3. Establish routines: Having a regular routine helps you get into a productive flow. If you know that every morning you’re going to review your to-do list and spend the first half of the day tackling your highest priority task, it becomes much easier to focus. 

4. Eliminate distractions: Identify the biggest distractions for you (Facebook, email, TV, etc.) and limit them as much as possible. 

5. Have a clear focus: make sure that you’re clear on what it is you’re trying to focus on and that you don’t have any other unrelated tasks running through your mind. 

6. Take breaks: Taking regular breaks can help reduce stress and fatigue and help you return to work feeling refreshed. 

7. Get organised: Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks and create achievable goals. 

8. Exercise: Regular exercise can help improve your concentration, sharpen your mind and boost your energy.
